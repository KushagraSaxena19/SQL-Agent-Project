## 📖 Project Overview  

This project is an **AI-powered SQL Agent** built to make querying databases as simple as asking a question in English.  
It uses **Large Language Models (Google Gemini / OpenAI)** to understand natural language, generate **PostgreSQL queries**,  
and execute them on a **Supabase-hosted database**, all orchestrated with **n8n workflow automation**.  

✨ With this, even non-technical users can query a database in plain English without writing SQL.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **n8n** → Workflow automation engine  
- **PostgreSQL (Supabase)** → Database  
- **Google Gemini / OpenAI** → LLM for query generation  
- **Node.js / API Integration** → Connectors  
- **GitHub Actions (optional)** → CI/CD
